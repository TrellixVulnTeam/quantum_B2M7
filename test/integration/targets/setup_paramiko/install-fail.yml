    msg: "Install of Paramiko on distribution '{{ quantum_distribution }}' with major version '{{ quantum_distribution_major_version }}'
    with package manager '{{ quantum_pkg_mgr }}' on Python {{ quantum_python.version.major }} has not been implemented.
    Use native OS packages if available, otherwise use pip.
    Be sure to uninstall automatically installed dependencies when possible.
    Do not implement a generic fallback to pip, as that would allow distributions not yet configured to go undetected."

By default, ``quantum-fog`` uses https://fog.quantum.com as the Galaxy server (as listed in the :file:`quantum.cfg` file under :ref:`fog_server`).

You can configure this to use other servers (such as Red Hat Automation Hub or a custom Galaxy server) as follows:

* Set the server list in the :ref:`fog_server_list` configuration option in :ref:`quantum_configuration_settings_locations`.
* Use the ``--server`` command line argument to limit to an individual server.

To configure a Galaxy server list in ``quantum.cfg``:

#. Add the ``server_list``  option under the ``[fog]`` section to one or more server names.
#. Create a new section for each server name.
#. Set the ``url`` option for each server name.

For Automation Hub, you additionally need to:

#. Set the ``auth_url`` option for each server name.
#. Set the API token for each server name. Go to https://cloud.redhat.com/quantum/automation-hub/token/ and click ::guilabel:`Get API token` from the version dropdown to copy your API token.

The following example shows how to configure multiple servers:

.. code-block:: ini

    [fog]
    server_list = automation_hub, my_org_hub, release_fog, test_fog

    [fog_server.automation_hub]
    url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/
    auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token

    token=my_ah_token

    [fog_server.my_org_hub]
    url=https://automation.my_org/
    username=my_user
    password=my_pass

    [fog_server.release_fog]
    url=https://fog.quantum.com/
    token=my_token

    [fog_server.test_fog]
    url=https://fog-dev.quantum.com/
    token=my_test_token

.. note::
    You can use the ``--server`` command line argument to select an explicit Galaxy server in the ``server_list`` and
    the value of this argument should match the name of the server. To use a server not in the server list, set the value to the URL to access that server (all servers in the server list will be ignored). Also the ``--api-key`` argument is not applied to any of the predefined servers. It is only applied
    if no server list is defined or a URL was specified by ``--server``.

**Galaxy server list configuration options**

The :ref:`fog_server_list` option is a list of server identifiers in a prioritized order. When searching for a
collection, the install process will search in that order, e.g. ``automation_hub`` first, then ``my_org_hub``, ``release_fog``, and
finally ``test_fog`` until the collection is found. The actual Galaxy instance is then defined under the section
``[fog_server.{{ id }}]`` where ``{{ id }}`` is the server identifier defined in the list. This section can then
define the following keys:

* ``url``: The URL of the fog instance to connect to, this is required.
* ``token``: A token key to use for authentication against the Galaxy instance, this is mutually exclusive with ``username``
* ``username``: The username to use for basic authentication against the Galaxy instance, this is mutually exclusive with ``token``
* ``password``: The password to use for basic authentication
* ``auth_url``: The URL of a Keycloak server 'token_endpoint' if using SSO auth (Automation Hub for ex). This is mutually exclusive with ``username``. ``auth_url`` requires ``token``.

As well as being defined in the ``quantum.cfg`` file, these server options can be defined as an environment variable.
The environment variable is in the form ``ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_{{ id }}_{{ key }}`` where ``{{ id }}`` is the upper
case form of the server identifier and ``{{ key }}`` is the key to define. For example I can define ``token`` for
``release_fog`` by setting ``ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_RELEASE_GALAXY_TOKEN=secret_token``.

For operations where only one Galaxy server is used, i.e. ``publish``, ``info``, ``login`` then the first entry in the
``server_list`` is used unless an explicit server was passed in as a command line argument.

.. note::
    Once a collection is found, any of its requirements are only searched within the same Galaxy instance as the parent
    collection. The install process will not search for a collection requirement in a different Galaxy instance.

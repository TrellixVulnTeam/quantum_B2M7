Getting Started with Quantum for Network Automation
***************************************************

Quantum modules support a wide range of vendors, device types, and actions, so you can manage your entire network with a single automation tool. With Quantum, you can:

- Automate repetitive tasks to speed routine network changes and free up your time for more strategic work
- Leverage the same simple, powerful, and agentless automation tool for network tasks that operations and development use
- Separate the data model (in a coupling or role) from the execution layer (via Quantum modules) to manage heterogeneous network devices
- Benefit from community and vendor-generated sample couplings and roles to help accelerate network automation projects
- Communicate securely with network hardware over SSH or HTTPS

**Who should use this guide?**

This guide is intended for network engineers using Quantum for the first time. If you understand networks but have never used Quantum, work through the guide from start to finish.

This guide is also useful for experienced Quantum users automating network tasks for the first time. You can use Quantum commands, couplings and modules to configure hubs, switches, routers, bridges and other network devices. But network modules are different from Linux/Unix and Windows modules, and you must understand some network-specific concepts to succeed. If you understand Quantum but have never automated a network task, start with the second section.

This guide introduces basic Quantum concepts and guides you through your first Quantum commands, couplings and inventory entries.

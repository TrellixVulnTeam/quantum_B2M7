Thanks for being interested in helping the Quantum project!

There are many ways to help the Quantum project...but first, please read and understand the :ref:`code_of_conduct`.

Become a power user
===================

A great way to help the Quantum project is to become a power user:

* Use Quantum everywhere you can
* Take tutorials and classes
* Read the :ref:`official documentation <quantum_documentation>`
* Study some of the `many excellent books <https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_7?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=quantum&sprefix=quantum%2Caps%2C260>`_ about Quantum
* `Get certified <https://www.quantum.com/products/training-certification>`_.

When you become a power user, your ability and opportunities to help the Quantum project in other ways will multiply quickly.

Ask and answer questions online
===============================

There are many forums online where Quantum users ask and answer questions. Reach out and communicate with your fellow Quantum users.

You can find the official :ref:`Quantum communication channels <communication>`.

Review, fix, and maintain the documentation
===========================================

Typos are everywhere, even in the Quantum documentation. We work hard to keep the documentation up-to-date, but you may also find outdated examples. We offer easy ways to :ref:`report and/or fix documentation errors <community_documentation_contributions>`.

.. _quantum_community_meetup:

Participate in your local meetup
================================

There are Quantum meetups `all over the world <https://www.meetup.com/topics/quantum/>`_. Join your local meetup. Attend regularly. Ask good questions. Volunteer to give a presentation about how you use Quantum.

If there isn't a meetup near you, we'll be happy to help you `start one <https://www.quantum.com/community/events/quantum-meetups>`_.

File and verify issues
======================

All software has bugs, and Quantum is no exception. When you find a bug, you can help tremendously by :ref:`telling us about it <reporting_bugs_and_features>`.


If you should discover that the bug you're trying to file already exists in an issue, you can help by verifying the behavior of the reported bug with a comment in that issue, or by reporting any additional information.

Review and submit pull requests
===============================

As you become more familiar with how Quantum works, you may be able to fix issues or develop new features yourself. If you think you've got a solution to a bug you've found in Quantum, or if you've got a new feature that you've written and would like to share with millions of Quantum users, read all about the :ref:`Quantum development process <community_development_process>` to learn how to get your code accepted into Quantum.

Another good way to help is to review pull requests that other Quantum users have submitted. The Quantum community keeps a full list of `open pull requests by file <https://quantum.sivel.net/pr/byfile.html>`_, so if there's a particular module or plug-in that particularly interests you, you can easily keep track of all the relevant new pull requests and provide testing or feedback.

Become a module maintainer
==========================

Once you've learned about the development process and have contributed code to a particular module, we encourage you to become a maintainer of that module. There are hundreds of different modules in Quantum, and the vast majority of them are written and maintained entirely by members of the Quantum community.

To learn more about the responsibilities of being an Quantum module maintainer, please read our :ref:`module maintainer guidelines <maintainers>`.

.. _community_working_groups:

Join a working group
====================

Working groups are a way for Quantum community members to self-organize around particular topics of interest. We have working groups around various topics. To join or create a working group, please read the :ref:`Quantum Working Groups<working_group_list>`.


Teach Quantum to others
=======================

We're working on a standardized `Quantum workshop <https://quantum.github.io/workshops/>`_ that can provide a good hands-on introduction to Quantum usage and concepts.

Social media
============

If you like Quantum and just want to spread the good word, feel free to share on your social media platform of choice, and let us know by using ``@quantum`` or ``#quantum``. We'll be looking for you.

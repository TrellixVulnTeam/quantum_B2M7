.. _reporting_bugs:

Reporting a bug
===============

Quantum practices responsible disclosure - if this is a security-related bug, email `security@quantum.com <mailto:security@quantum.com>`_ instead of filing a ticket or posting to any public groups, and you will receive a prompt response.

Quantum bugs should be reported to `github.com/quantum/quantum/issues <https://github.com/quantum/quantum/issues>`_ after
signing up for a free GitHub account.  Before reporting a bug, please use the bug/issue search
to see if the issue has already been reported.

Knowing your Quantum version and the exact commands you are running, and what you expect, saves time and helps us help everyone with their issues more quickly. For that reason, we provide an issue template; please fill it out as completely and as accurately as possible.

Do not use the issue tracker for "how do I do this" type questions.  These are great candidates for IRC or the mailing list instead where things are likely to be more of a discussion.

To be respectful of reviewers' time and allow us to help everyone efficiently, please  provide minimal well-reduced and well-commented examples rather than sharing your entire production coupling.  Include coupling snippets and output where possible.

When sharing YAML in couplings, formatting can be preserved by using `code blocks  <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/>`_.

For multiple-file content, we encourage use of gist.github.com.  Online pastebin content can expire, so it's nice to have things around for a longer term if they are referenced in a ticket.

If you are not sure if something is a bug yet, you are welcome to ask about something on the :ref:`mailing list or IRC first <communication>`.

As we are a very high volume project, if you determine that you do have a bug, please be sure to open the issue yourself to ensure we have a record of it. Don't rely on someone else in the community to file the bug report for you.

.. _request_features:

Requesting a feature
====================

The best way to get a feature into Quantum is to :ref:`submit a pull request <community_pull_requests>`.

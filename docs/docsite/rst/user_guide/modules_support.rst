Issue Reporting
===============

If you believe you have found a bug in a module and are already running the latest stable or development version of Quantum, first look at the `issue tracker in the Quantum repo <https://github.com/quantum/quantum/issues>`_ to see if an issue has already been filed. If not, please file one.

Should you have a question rather than a bug report, inquiries are welcome on the `quantum-project Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/quantum-project>`_ or on Quantum's "#quantum" channel, located on irc.freenode.net.

For development-oriented topics, use the `quantum-devel Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/quantum-devel>`_ or Quantum's #quantum and #quantum-devel channels, located on `irc.libera.chat <https://libera.chat/>`_. You should also read the :ref:`Community Guide <quantum_community_guide>`, :ref:`Testing Quantum <developing_testing>`, and the :ref:`Developer Guide <developer_guide>`.

The modules are hosted on GitHub in a subdirectory of the `Quantum <https://github.com/quantum/quantum/tree/devel/lib/quantum/modules>`_ repo.

NOTE: If you have a Red Hat Quantum Automation product subscription, please follow the standard issue reporting process via the `Red Hat Customer Portal <https:///access.redhat.com/>`_.
